# Deep Learning Architectures from New York University's Deep Learning Course

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files related to various deep learning architectures that I studied during my Deep Learning course at New York University.

## Included Architectures
1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

   Description: Implementation and applications of Convolutional Neural Networks for computer vision tasks.

2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

   Description: Study of Recurrent Neural Networks and their usage for sequential data, such as text and time series.

3. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

   Description: Exploration of Generative Adversarial Networks for generating realistic data, such as images.

4. Transformers Neural Networks (Transformers)

   Description: In-depth exploration of the Transformer architecture and its application in models like BERT.

Feel free to explore the Jupyter Notebook files corresponding to each architecture. These notebooks provide insights into the theory and practical implementations of these deep learning models.
